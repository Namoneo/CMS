# Backend – NestJS

This directory contains the NestJS backend for the CMS.  The backend provides APIs for storing and retrieving content, media assets, authentication and authorization, and other CMS features.

Currently this directory includes only a minimal NestJS setup with an `AppModule` and a bootstrap script.  To develop the backend further, you should:

1. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager (e.g. `npm install`).
2. Implement modules for content types, media management, authentication, and user roles.
3. Use Prisma, TypeORM or another ORM to connect to a database.

Refer to the NestJS documentation for guidance on building scalable APIs.
