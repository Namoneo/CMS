# CMS Project

This repository contains a starter CMS project built with **Angular** on the frontend and **NestJS** on the backend.

The goal of this project is to provide a foundation for building a full visual CMS/website builder.  Right now it contains only a minimal skeleton; you can extend it to include drag‑and‑drop page building, live preview, authentication, media management, and more.

## Structure

- `frontend/`: Angular application for the CMS user interface.
- `backend/`: NestJS application serving as the CMS API.

Each of these directories contains its own `README.md` with more details and guidance for further development.
